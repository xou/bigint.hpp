bigint.hpp
==========

Toy biginteger library in C++

This is neither high-performance, nor exactly clean or clever or something, i
built this because i wanted to see if i could do basic arithmetic without looking
at other people's code or algorithms. Code is mostly tested though and should
work ok. Negative numbers are not completely finished yet.
